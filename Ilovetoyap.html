            About me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Allow me to share a bit about myself! I have spent a lot of time trying to narrow my interests to one passion, or vocation. I have come to terms with the breadth of my hobbies and interests and find it okay! I am a jack of all trades (master of none of course). I dabble into a little bit of everything hobby wise, such as baking/cooking, thrift shopping, playing the piano and guitar, reading, making playlists, video games, tennis/pickleball, crocheting, and probably more. I love enjoying a sweet treat, or any good meal for that matter and my favorite pastimes are exploring new cities, napping, and lowballing on depop.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
             I am born and raised in Tulsa, and made the genius idea of staying for college (its actually grown on me now). I am studying Cyber Security, with a minor in Bioinformatics. It may seem like a weird combination but put simply, I am passionate for cutting-edge science and would love to utilize my curiousity and desire for innovation to better the world. If I am able to understand biological systems, I can apply this knowledge to cyber systems as computers resemble bioscience functions. I may do vise-versa by learning to further ethically synthesize biology or protect our biology like I can do digital systems! This will probably ultimately leave me in Biotechnology, hopefully with the world as my oyster!

            What I have been into lately
        </h3>
        <p>
            I recently found out that the Denmark national bird is a Swan. This is fitting and I have seen them quite often here which has been pretty pleasant.

            I go through an annual phase of finding an original version of a sampled song and then I fall down a rabbit hole of needing to find every sampled song and the matching new version or vice versa. I am currently in this phase of course. This is best done in rap music and it is fascinating to see how the music evolves.
            <br>
            I have been weirdly craving a Lobster Roll, since before I left the states. I keep forgetting and still have yet to get one but rest assured I will be updating my food blog when it happens.
            <br>
            In Prague I found vanilla creme filled bicoff cookies, and they were so good and I cant find them anywhere else, which is so sad. Update: I found some that are biscoff creme filled, might be overkill but I am still excited to try.
            <br>
            Absurdism. It is just to condition myself to remember nothing is as serious as I make it out to be and life is silly and the best way to cope is to play with the cards I am dealt.
            <br>
            Vanilla Iced Berry Redbull. Maybe my new favorite flavor, they have it in sugar-free now too!

            Socials

        <p>
            I indulge in various forms of brainrot. You can find me on almost every form of social media, including but not limited to twitter (not calling it X), letterboxd, pintrest, goodreads, linkedin, spotify (is that social?), etc. Feel free to find me on those, I love sharing my wherabouts in life with my friends.
