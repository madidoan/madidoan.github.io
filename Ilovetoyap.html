            About me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Allow me to share a bit about myself! I have spent a lot of time trying to narrow my interests to one passion, or vocation. I have come to terms with the breadth of my hobbies and interests and find it okay! I am a jack of all trades (master of none of course). I dabble into a little bit of everything hobby wise, such as baking/cooking, thrift shopping, playing the piano and guitar, reading, making playlists, video games, tennis/pickleball, crocheting, and probably more. I love enjoying a sweet treat, or any good meal for that matter and my favorite pastimes are exploring new cities, napping, and lowballing on depop.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
             I am born and raised in Tulsa, and made the genius idea of staying for college (its actually grown on me now). I am studying Cyber Security, with a minor in Bioinformatics. Its a weird combination but put simply, I am passionate for cutting-edge science and would love to utilize my curiousity and desire for innovation to better the world. Combining the foundation of science (biology) with the future of science (computer science) is rapidly altering our reality. While I am interested in computers themselves (the architecture and machine learning techniques), studying this field mostly entails programming and software development. This can be gratifying and fulfilling to create, but I am no engineer and find this area too open-ended and would rather focus on moving forward from broader ideas to implement change on a large scale. This is why I am resided in Cyber Security, which I have thoroughly enjoyed, especially the blue team side. My specific future with Biotechnology is undetermined but I see the world as my oyster with this background I've been given!

        <h3>
            What I have been into lately
        </h3>
        <p>
            I am a decently avid movie watcher. While I am currently abroad I am trying to limit my digital use, lately I have gained another knack for Studio Ghibli movies. I am sure you can understand why.
            <br>
            Ive always been into Beach House, however I am going through another phase. Their music is so beautiully crafted with unusual instruments adding to the essence and its so melodic and harmoninous. When they put organs into their songs I actually melt.
            <br>
            I have been weirdly craving a Lobster Roll, since before I left the states. I keep forgetting and still have yet to get one but rest assured I will be updating my food blog when it happens.
            <br>
            Jazz. So good and revolutionary even past its golden age. The musical skill and entropy of instruments just dances with eachother to make such innovative rythms and riffs.
            <br>
            I have been chipping away at my biscoff cookie stash each night. Something about them just makes the perfect light dessert.
            <br>
            Maybe because I am starting to get homesick, but I actually really love my country origins. Telling people I am from Oklahoma is such a delight. Brought my bolo tie, left the boots and hat at home and I am sad because I should've forced these items onto CPH.
            <br>
            Vanilla Iced Berry Redbull. Maybe my new favorite flavor, they have it in sugar-free now too!

            I indulge in various forms of brainrot. You can find me on almost every form of social media, including but not limited to twitter (not calling it X), letterboxd, pintrest, goodreads, spotify (is that social?), etc. Feel free to find me on those, I love sharing my wherabouts in life with my friends.
