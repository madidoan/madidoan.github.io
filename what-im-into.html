      <p> I am a sucker for a good sample or interpolation. It's even more satisfying when you are able to recognize it audibly. Because I am hedonistic, this natural satisfaction isn't enough and I need to find out if any song ever is sampled from another. I have been utulizing WhoSampled quite a bit and it's been helpful to find these correlations. The art of sampling fascinates me and emphasizes the cyclical nature of music but also the innovation it takes when someone can take some soul from the 70s and turn it into a tasteful techno rebrand. It takes a good ear to do so and I admire it dearly. </p>

      <p> Recently, I have been obsessed with the color red. It is representative of so much. Red is the universal color for love. Red is rage. Red is indicative of split blood or flushed cheeks. We stop at the sight of it because it catches our attention. The correspondence between red and flesh and blood in turn becomes a beacon of passion. Red is the closest color to ressemble humanity and serves as a reminder of what we are capable of.</p>

      <p> I have been implementing this small change in my routine where I put on a different perfume for each day of the week. It is a privilage to say such a thing, but this is my way of allowing each to be used and spicing up a mundane routine. I finally have the courage to stray away from having a signature scent. While that still seems appetizing, my sporadic life craves change. Monday is delicate and dewey. Saturday is rich and delectable. So on.</p>

      <p> Other things: Absurdism, ice cream sandwiches, Sunday driving, lobsters, and admiring my friends for being so clever. </p>
