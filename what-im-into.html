        <h4>
          Borrowed Music
        </h4>

      <p> I am a sl*t for a good sample or interpolation. It's so satisfying recognizing one audibly. Because I am hedonistic, this natural satisfaction isn't enough and I have to find out if any song I've ever heard is sampled from another. Lately, I've been utilizing WhoSampled and it's been helpful to find these correlations. The art of sampling fascinates me and emphasizes both the cyclical nature of music and also the innovation it takes when someone can take a soulful 70's track and turn it into a tasteful techno rebrand. It takes a good ear to do it well, and I admire it dearly. </p>

        <h4> Wardrobe Ingenuity
        </h4>

      <p>
        Recently, I was telling my dad how I am getting into mixing cowboy boots in with my outfits, and he suggested turning it into more of a statement of combining my cultures through fashion (as a Wasian). Crafting a cohesive Asian streetwear look with a touch of country seems like a tough challenge, but I am willing to experiment and find a sweet spot with the two. I do like how original and symbolic this could be if I am able to pull it off. We'll see!

      <h4>All Things Red</h4>

      <p> I am obsessed with the color red. It's representative of so much. Red is love. Red is rage. Red is indicative of spilt blood or flushed cheeks. The correspondence between red and flesh and blood, in turn becomes a beacon of passion. Red is the closest hue to ressemble humanity and serves as a reminder of what we are capable of.</p>

      <h4>Others:</h4>

      <p> Mixing metals, Rumikub, funny people, absurdism, scrapbooking, ice cream sandwiches, lobsters, and walks along the river. </p>
