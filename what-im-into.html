      <p> I am a sl*t for a good sample or interpolation. It's so satisfying recognizing one audibly. Because I am hedonistic, this natural satisfaction isn't enough and I have to find out if any song I've ever heard is sampled from another. Lately, I've been utilizing WhoSampled and it's been helpful to find these correlations. The art of sampling fascinates me and emphasizes both the cyclical nature of music and also the innovation it takes when someone can take a soulful 70's track and turn it into a tasteful techno rebrand. It takes a good ear to do it well, and I admire it dearly. </p>

        Recently, I was telling my dad how I am getting into mixing cowboy boots in with my outfits, and he suggested turning it into more of a statement of combining my cultures through fashion (as a Wasian). Crafting a cohesive Asian streetwear look with a touch of country seems like a tough challenge, but I am willing to experiment and find a sweet spot with the two. I do like how original and symbolic this could be if I am able to pull it off. We'll see!
      </p>

      <p> I am obsessed with the color red. It's representative of so much. Red is love. Red is rage. Red is indicative of spilt blood or flushed cheeks. The correspondence between red and flesh and blood, in turn becomes a beacon of passion. Red is the closest hue to ressemble humanity and serves as a reminder of what we are capable of.</p>

      <p> I have been implementing this small change in my routine where I wear a different perfume for each day of the week. It is a privilage to say such a thing, but this is my way of allowing each to be used and spicing up a mundane routine. I finally found the courage to stray away from having a signature scent. While that still seems appetizing, my sporadic life craves variation. Monday is delicate and dewey. Saturday is rich and delectable. So on. </p>

      <p> Other things: Mixing metals, absurdism, ice cream sandwiches, Sunday driving, lobsters, and admiring my friends for being so clever. </p>
