        Ava June's is the new fine dining talk of the town on the corner of Cherry Street. To be frank, I was saddened to hear that Palace Cafe was no longer, but Ava June's, so far, has seemed to be a fit replacement. What used to be an ambient and moody atmosphere, has now become a delicate and organic front with exquisite cuisine. While we are landlocked, their oysters do meet up to standard and the beef bourguignon is rich in flavor. Do check it out, or for a mellower vibe, Lo-Fi pizza right next door can serve you up a delicious pie.

        I have been meaning to try Prism Cafe for some time now, and let me relay that it does not disappoint. Of course they locally source their ingredients, but any local restauarant can do so. What makes them standout is the execution and melody of flavors the put on a plate. Not only does everything taste so fresh and geniune, but it also encapsulates elevated familiarities. You can't go wrong with a sandwich, but a great example of this is their signature cold brew. This delicacy is topped with madagascar vanilla and maple infused cold foam, with the perfect dash of cinnamon. I implore you to explore all of the wonderful options on their menu as I continue to do so as well.

      What's going on with Flo's Burger Diner? If anyone recalls this mom and pop diner off 11th street, this was such a true hearted American diner. Menu ranging from classics to something a little bit inventive, all while still managing to not break the bank (especially in this economy). Their sides of fried pickles, tots, fried jalepenos, etc was the perfect indulgence. Now, it seems that entity is closed and there is a new "Flo's Smokehouse Eats" not too far down the road? Supposedly one in the same. Will this new establishment be up to par to the original? If you have tried this new joint, please let me know, otherwise I will do the good deed of testing it out and reporting back to HQ.

        Family Thai by Ailis: "Family Thai is a cozy Thai restaurant nestled in a strip mall off behind the ever present construction of 11th street. The yellow walls, friendly staff, and smells create an inviting atmosphere. The food is fantastic, from noodles to curries to appetizers, every dish is delicious. I love the green curry with tofu, the fried tofu appetizer, and the drunken noodles. I highly recommend Family Thai, you can’t get better Thai food in Tulsa."

      <p> Notes of Marrakesh by Trey: "The owner is genuine and doesn’t care about catering to American taste because she believes if she likes it, so will other people. The menu is very intentional, so you can’t really go wrong with your order. The drinks are deserve recognition. They have delicious smoothies, cocktails with fresh fruit, and the tea is amazing."
