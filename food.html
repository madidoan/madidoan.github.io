      <p> Here are some of my favorite places to eat and drink here in Tulsa. Many do not comply with the Google Maps API, so feel free to check out the full list <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hWybYeg5UTg4r2er6" target="_blank"> here.</a> </p>

        Places worth mention: 
      </h4>

      <P>
         My friends and I have been on a Korean Garden kick. Each of their dishes are robust in flavor and made with love. The assortment of banchan (radish, bean sprouts, cucumber, etc) that comes out with your meal is such a delight. We like to go family style and it seems the best way to get a variety of tastes without breaking the bank.

        Pony Coffee has become my go to coffee shop. For starters, the atmosphere is exactly what you want out of a cafe: a consistent theme, plenty of plants, and eccentric furniture. I'm no coffee snob, but I do approve of their offerings. Their pastries are especially tasty. I often go to get work done with the intent to put in my airpods, but I always end up taking them out because their music choices are sometimes better than mine.

      Lastly, everyone's favorite sandwiches. Trenchers is super homey, with a bar and late night cravings availability. Their menu features top-notch sandwiches ranging from complex and stacked to classics. For cold cuts I go for the Coolio, and for something warm, the Chicken Tawook is superb. However, there are so many charactaristic sandwiches to choose from. Check it out if you haven't. I'm also not sure what their obsession with Patrick Swayze is, but I dig it.

        What are the people recommending?
      </h4>

      <p>
        Family Thai by Ailis: "Family Thai is a cozy Thai restaurant nestled in a strip mall off behind the ever present construction of 11th street.  The yellow walls, friendly staff, and smells create an inviting atmosphere. The food is fantastic, from noodles to curries to appetizers, every dish is delicious. I love the green curry with tofu, the fried tofu appetizer, and the drunken noodles. I highly recommend Family Thai, you can’t get better Thai food in Tulsa."
      </p>

      <p> Notes of Marrakesh by Trey: "The owner is genuine and doesn’t care about catering to American taste because she believes if she likes it, so will other people. The menu is very intentional, so you can’t really go wrong with your order. The drinks are deserve recognition. They have delicious smoothies, cocktails with fresh fruit, and the tea is amazing."
      </p>

      <p>
        Oren by Kate: "Oren is hands-down my favorite. Convienently located on Brookside, this spot serves up consistently delicious dishes with perfected depth and exceptional service. I never stick to just one entree. Their apps and small plates are where the magic happens. The charred broccoli is a must, the brandy over ice cream is dreamy, and they send you off with a fresh cookie to accompany the check."
