         My friends and I have been on a Korean Garden kick. I have yet to have a bad dish from here. All dishes are vibrant with flavor and made with love. The marinated radish, bean sprouts, cucumnber, etc. that come out with your meal are such a delight. We like to go family style and it seems the best way to get a variety of tastes while still not breaking the bank.

        Pony Coffee has been my go to coffee shop recently. For starters, the atmosphere is exactly want you want out of a coffee space: a consistent theme, plenty of plants, and eccentric furniture. I am no coffee snob, but I do approve of their offerings. Their pastries are especially tasty. Not to mention I often go to get work done with the intentions of putting my airpods in and I always end up taking them out because of their good music choices.

      Lastly, everyone's favorite sandwiches: Trenchers. The inside is super homey, with a bar and late night cravings availability. Their menu with top-notch hot and sandwiches ranging from complex stacked sandwiches to classics. For cold cuts, I go for the Coolio, Chicken Tawook for warm, but there are so many charactaristic sandwiches to choose from. Check it out if you haven't. I am also not sure what their obsession with Patrick Swayze is about, but I dig it.

        Family Thai by Ailis: Family Thai is a cozy Thai restaurant nestled in a strip mall off behind the ever present construction of 11th street.  The yellow walls, friendly staff, and smells create an inviting atmosphere. The food is fantastic, from noodles to curries to appetizers, every dish is delicious. I love the green curry with tofu, the fried tofu appetizer, and the drunken noodles. I highly recommend Family Thai, you can’t get better Thai food in Tulsa.

      <p> Markesh by Trey: "The owner is genuine and doesn’t care aboutt catering to american tastes because she believes if she likes it so will other people, the menu is very intentional so you can’t really go wrong with your order and the tea is amazing"
