      <p> Tulsa is a quaint city that is like a nutshell; it's value lies in the effort and patience it takes to open it. The captivation of this city lies in the intracies and idiosyncracies that you must put forth the time to invest in. From the eccentric honky tonk "Mercury Lounge" to a classic "Webers" Root Beer, there is undeniable charm awaiting every Tulsan. </p>

      <p> Allow me to walk you through the allure of my hometown and why you should visit/stay. Whether it be the slow-living and homey feel, the neo-country aesthetic, or the arts, Tulsa remains a dime to those who can see it.</p>

      <p> Community and tribalism is key to residential comfortability. </p>

      <p> Community is central to what we do. If you’re into creative tools, low-res aesthetics, and late 90s tech, you’re in good company.</p>
