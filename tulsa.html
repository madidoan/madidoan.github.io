      <p> Tulsa's captivation lies in its intricacies and idiosyncrasies that you must take the time to invest in. Tulsa is patient, passionate, quaint, and intimate. There are several wonderful developments happening here, and when these evolutions marry the historical core features, an undeniable charm awaits every Tulsan. </p>

      <p> There is something so enticing about the perfect size of Tulsa. You can drive downtown on a sunny Saturday afternoon and encounter minimal traffic, yet find life awaiting wherever you are headed. The entire county can be crossed in just about 30 minutes from one edge to another. Communities aren't oversaturated; You may not know your neighbor, but someone you're acquainted with likely does. </p>

      <p> Allow me to walk you through the allure of my hometown and why you should visit or stay. Whether it be the slow-living and homey feel, the neo-country aesthetic, or the vibrant arts, Tulsa remains a dime to those who know how to see it.</p>
