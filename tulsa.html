      <p> Tulsa's captivation lies in the intracies and idiosyncracies that you must set aside time to invest in. Tulsa is patient, passionate, quaint, and intimate. There are several wonderful developments happening in this city, and when these evolutions marry the historical core features, there becomes an undeniable charm awaiting every Tulsan. </p>

      <p> There is something so enticing about the perfect size of Tulsa. Here you can drive downtown on a Sunny Saturday afternoon and experience minimal traffic, but expect life awaiting wherever you are headed. The entire radius of the county takes you just about 30 minutes to get from one edge to another. Communities aren't oversaturated. You may not know your neighbor, but someone you are acquainted with likely does. </p>

      <p> Allow me to walk you through the allure of my hometown and why you should visit/stay. Whether it be the slow-living and homey feel, the neo-country aesthetic, or the arts, Tulsa remains a dime to those who can see it.</p>
