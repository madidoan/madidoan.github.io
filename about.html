      <p> Bare with me if you feel so inclined to read a page about myself. I am a jack of all trades (implies master of none) hence the mediocre writing and subpar frontend development. I used to sulk about not having one vocation or passion to go depths to discover, but I have recently learned to appreciate the breadth of my interests. I believe being well rounded can carry you miles. So here I am with a lifestyle blog dedicated to highlighting simple pleasures from the intangible to what all five senses can explore. All while still conforming to a corporate cubicle job to keep up with technological advances and fund my personal enrichment. </p>

      <p> More: I am a chronic rule follower. At most times anxious and aloof. I can parallel park in one fell swoop. My favorite passtimes are exploring cities, naps, and lowballing on depop. You will not catch me going a day without enjoying a sweet treat. I also firmly believe that there's no such thing as bad food. </p>

      <p> Having talked about Oklahoma pride and feeling passionate about the conversations we need to have surrounding it, I must confess that I'm actually full of shame and contradictions. I truly do love it here, however, I would love to travel to the ends of the world or even live in a saturated city such as New York City or Berlin for a little bit. Who knows. Maybe I'll come back and take what I've learned with me, but the magic lies in my oyster I have yet to explore. </p>

        <p> While I've mentioned thrift stores and vintage clothes many times, let me have a shameless plug moment to say that I own a small thrift business. You can find it at 11th and Yale "Generations Antiques", booth 62. I also have an instagram @thriftfrommadi. Truth be told, I've neglected it as I feel I haven't had the time to shop for it, but do trust that I'll be putting quality items there in due time. Hit her up! </p>

        <p> Lastly, if you got this far, thank you once again for interacting with this creation of mine. If you have any suggestions or comments, I could add a suggestion box perhaps, but if you are seeing this you likely have the means to reach me. Please give me grace for putting myself out there to be percieved and stay tuned for any updates to come. Sending my love!
