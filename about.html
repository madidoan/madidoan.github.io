      <p> Welcome to the page dedicated to myself. Bare with me! I am a jack of all trades (implies master of none) hence the mediocre writing and subpar frontend development. I used to sulk about not having one vocation or passion to go depths to discover or perfect, but I have recently learned to appreciate the breadth of my interests. I believe being a well rounded person can carry you miles. So now here I am with a lifestyle blog dedicated to highlighting simple pleasures from the intangible to what all five senses can explore. All while still conforming to a corporate cubicle job to keep up with digital developments and fund my personal enrichment. </p>

      <p> I am a chronic rule follower. At most times anxious and aloof. My favorite passtimes are naps and lowballing on depop. You will never catch me saying no to a sweet treat. I also firmly believe that there's no such thing as bad food. If I had to label myself as a fruit I would say I am a peach. Soft, good-natured, and a solid core. </p>

      <p> Having talked about Oklahoma pride and feeling passionate about the conversations we need to have surronding it, I must confess that I am actually full of shame and bullshit. I do love it here, however my ultimate goal is to move to New York City and immerse myself in the overstimulating stye that it is. In all seriousness, the quick paced atmosphere, layers of culture, and endless opportunities just thrill me. It would be a dream to do some simple living such as working at a bakery or record store. Who knows. Maybe I will come back someday and take what I have learned with me, but the magic lies in the unknown. </p>

      <p> While I have mentioned thrift stores and vintage clothes many times, let me have a shameless plug moment and say that I own a small thrift business. You can find it at 11th and Yale "Generations Antiques" booth 62. I also have an instagran @thriftfrommadi. Truth be told I have deglected it as I feel I haven't had the time to shop for it, but do trust that I will be putting quality items there in due time. Hit her up! </p>

      <p> Lastly, thank you for taking the time not only to read about me, but to be clicking around on this side project of mine that I ended up getting too invested in. If you have any suggestions or comments I could add a suggestion box perhaps, but if you are seeing this you likely have the means to reach me. I love you all and thank you engaing with me from my ones and zeros to yours. </p>
