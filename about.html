      <p> Welcome to the page dedicated to myself. Bare with me! I am a jack of all trades (implies master of none) hence the mediocre writing and subpar frontend development. I used to sulk about not having one vocation or passion to go depths to discover, but I have recently learned to appreciate the breadth of my interests. I believe being a well rounded person can carry you miles. So here I am with a lifestyle blog dedicated to highlighting simple pleasures from the intangible to what all five senses can explore. All while still conforming to a corporate cubicle job to keep up with technological advances and fund my personal enrichment. </p>

      <p> More: I am a chronic rule follower. At most times anxious and aloof. I can at parallel park in one fell swoop. My favorite passtimes are exploring cities, naps, and lowballing on depop. You will not catch me going a day without enjoying a sweet treat. I also firmly believe that there's no such thing as bad food. </p>

      <p> Having talked about Oklahoma pride and feeling passionate about the conversations we need to have surronding it, I must confess that I am actually full of shame and contradictions. I truly do love it here, however, my ultimate goal is to move to New York City and immerse myself in the overstimulating stye that it is. In all seriousness, the quick paced atmosphere, layers of culture, and endless opportunities just thrill me. It would be a dream to do some simple living such as working at a bakery or record store. Who knows. Maybe I will come back and take what I have learned with me, but the magic lies in my oyster I have yet to explore. </p>

        <p> While I have mentioned thrift stores and vintage clothes many times, let me have a shameless plug moment and say that I own a small thrift business. You can find it at 11th and Yale "Generations Antiques", booth 62. I also have an instagram @thriftfrommadi. Truth be told, I have neglected it as I feel I haven't had the time to shop for it, but do trust that I will be putting quality items there in due time. Hit her up! </p>

        <p> Lastly, if you got this far, thank you once again for interacting with this creation of mine. If you have any suggestions or comments, I could add a suggestion box perhaps, but if you are seeing this you likely have the means to reach me. Please give me grace for putting myself out there to be percieved and stay tuned for any updates to come. Sending my love! </p>
