    <img src="pics/IMG_5970.jpeg" alt="Tres Leches" style="width: 200px;height:240px;">
    Strawberry Tres Leches cake. So good and refreshing, enough said. Found at "Luv 'em Leches"!
    <img src="pics/food.jpeg" alt="food" style="width: 200px;height:240px;">
    Buffalo Lemon Pepper Catfish. Came with hush puppies and cajun fries as well, so worth the 15.99. They asked me if I wanted any sauces (for free) after as well! So thats a plus imo. Found at "Little New Orleans".

    <img src="pics/IMG_6099.jpeg" alt="hd" style="width: 200px;height:240px;">
    Danish hot dog. Fried onions, raw onions, remalaude, and pickles. Life changing if you're into dogs.

    Part of a lovely five course meal at "Gemini" in CPH. Hake with champagne sauce, fennel, and broccolini.
    <img src="pics/IMG_6419.jpeg" alt="Wagamama" style="width: 200px;height:240px;">
    Gochugang chicken at "Wagamama" at Tivoli Gardens. So delicious I ate it all. My friend got bolgogi beef w/ soba noodles and it was just as good tbh.
