    Yummy Buffalo Lemon Pepper Catfish. Came with hush puppies and cajun fries as well, so worth the 15.99. They asked me if I wanted any sauces (for free) after as well! So thats a plus imo. Found at "Little New Orleans".

    Danish hot dog. Fried onions, raw onions, remalaude, and pickles. Life changing if you're into dogs.

    Part of a lovely five course meal at "Gemini" in CPH. Just pictured is the main course of Hake with champagne sauce, fennel, and broccolini.

    Gochugang chicken at "Wagamama" at Tivoli Gardens. So delicious I ate it all. My friend got bolgogi beef w/ soba noodles and it was just as good tbh. Not a bad price for Tivoli as well.

    One of my best finds by accident. At "Bagelicious", found in a cute part of CPH called Norrebro. The owner was so nice and explained the concept and offered me free lemon water to fill my bottle. They had a byob type bar ranging from hummus, to pesto chicken, brie, etc. I got a chili cheddar bagel that they press and filled with herb cream cheese, tandoori chicken, lto, cucumber, and their house sauce that you know I had to get. 10/10, forced me to figure out how to use word wrap for css.

    The moment you (I) have been waiting for. I went to "Buka" and got their famous pistacio crossiant. I have to say it was pretty good and met my expectations. The first picture is their special of the day which was a citrusy cheeecake pastry. Both were super flakey and delicious but the special of the day may have been my favorite, despite being nearly impossible to cut into.

    <br>
    At "Vanlose Bistro" I got the special of beed stroganoff. My god this was so good, as you can tell I wasn't thinking to take a picture, and its not the prettiest. Anyway the sides were just as good. A scalped potato stack, fennel with cesar, blueberries, and dill, soy broccoli with peanuts, and salad with mustard dressing and buckwheat. Back to the stoganoff to say it was so rich and the beef was nice and tender, probably the best meal yet.

    Finally got to try the Danish classic of "open faces sandwiches". I got the danish meatball option and honestly not bad! I don't usually love cold food however this was nice and refreshing.
