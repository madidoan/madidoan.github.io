      <p> Let's talk about the geopgraphic implications of being in Tulsa. Are we in the South or the Midwest? A debate that will forever remain close to an Oklahoman's heart. This limbo is essential to Tulsa characteristics. With our surrondings, it's no secret we a blue dot in a red state (sometimes not even blue). This serves as a deterant for many. While I understand escaping those who are directly affected by the political state of the world, it disapoints me to see those privilages and able to make a change turning their back on a city with so much potential such as ours. "Getting out of here" only leaves everyone else sticking it out or unable leave in the dust to rot. </p>

      <p> We have a duty as Tulsa natives to contribute to the upwards trajectory and share ideas, arts, and experiences to better our city. We are the state home to the most Native American culture; We have to fight to continue to bring attention to this part of us. Greenwood has been educating, flourishing, and creating a safe space. We are earning "country inspired" establishments that are openly progressive. People are putting in the work and things are changing, and while there is so much to celebrate, there is a lot of potential for more if we show up and show out. While I want to advocate for the minority in Tulsa, it's also not my place to speak on their behalf. We can appreciate it at the very least. Go to culture specific museums, support small businesses, stay awhile. Vote. Play your part. </p>

      <p> What I feel I can speak on, is the cowboys, honkytonk, white-trash element of living here. While I also used to have a disdain for all things country, I have turned a new leaf. The affilations I made with country would be the biggest repellent, but I can choose to reclaim it. This area of the US has such a strong lifestyle and we can approach it with pride (while still acknowledging the past and present wrongs). You know whats good fun? Accessorizing with cowboy hats, boots, and bolo ties. Honkytonks? Live music and sqaure dancing with a loved one. Don't you get a little tickle when someone says you have a bit of an accent? We can embrace these parts of living in the country, see it for the better, and make it our own. Country couture. </p>
