      <p> For thrifting I find the most at Family and Children Services Thrift Store, H.O.W., and Mama's Boutique. Mama's Boutique is something I want to gatekeep but the guy who owns it is so sweet and deserves every bit of business. Vintage is a different story. If you don't mind paying an extra dime for curation, Tulsa Vintage Co is great as well as their neighbor, Polly Hester. Harrison Rose too. A little bit smaller but still great is The Sobo and my friend Meghan runs and markets very well for MeggysVintageGoods. She often does popups or meet ups so check her out on instagram!</p>

      <p> The Tulsa band scene is also worth checking out. My favorites are the Manta Rays, King Cabbage Brass Band, and Broncho (duh). I also have some friends who started a band less than a year ago that you should invest in before they start flourishing too hard: Jam On Toast. </p>

      <p> Extra: Check out the Tulsa tunnels. ThePickup (formally the root) is a great forum for discovering Tulsa and finding events happening each weekend. You can follow them on social medias but I think their subscription would be worth it. Watching a quirky movie at Circle Cinema. First Friday Downtown. Farmers Market. Philbrook when the tulips are in peak. </p>
