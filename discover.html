        We have a beauitfully designed Frank Lloyd Wright house here in Tulsa.

        For thrifting I find the most at Family and Children Services Thrift Store, H.O.W., and Mama's Boutique. Mama's Boutique is something I've debated gatekeeping, but the owner is so sweet and deserves every bit of business. </p>
        
        <p> Vintage is a different story. If you don't mind paying an extra dime for curation, check out: The Flip Side Collective, Tulsa Vintage Co, as well as their neighbor, Polly Hester, and Harrington Rose too. Additionally, the Sobo, and my friend Meghan runs and markets very well for MeggysVintageGoods. She often does popups or meet ups, so check her out on instagram! </p>

      <p> The Tulsa band scene is of course worth checking out. My favorites are the Manta Rays, King Cabbage Brass Band, Broncho (duh), and Velvetine, a shoegaze band a friend recently put me onto. The same friend is in a newly formed band that you should invest in: Jam On Toast. </p>

        <img src="pics/tulips.jpg" class="side-image" alt="Philbrook">
        Also worth note is the Tulsa Punk Rock Flea Market, Time Travelers Vintage Expo, First Friday Downtown, The Farmers Market, Tulsa Really Really Free Market, Tulsa Tough, Oktoberfest, Philbrook tulip season, Circle Cinema, Mayfest, Wednesday Trivia Night at the Pump, and Food Truck Wednesday's at Guthrie Green.

        Extra: <a href="https://thepickup.com/" target="_blank">ThePickup</a> (formally The Root) is a great forum for discovering Tulsa and finding events happening each weekend. You can follow them on social media, but I think a subscription to their website would be well worth it. <a href="https://aslutzine.com/" target="_blank">ASLUT</a> magazine is also making phenomenal strides for the Tulsa art scene. They host events, make commentary, and push boundaries. It's truly all things art and pop culutre. Check them out as well. </p>
