      <p> Welcome to & Main where analog charm meets digital clarity. We’re dedicated to crafting tools for people who like their coffee black and their design minimal. I am adding more things so i can test the limits of this website. there is an art of bullshit that I am not seasoned nor brave enough to engage in, therefor I do not possess the talent to talk about nothing extensively. I love tulsa and im sorry this description lacks propriatary means for the websites essence. If anyone were to ever magically visit this i am effed. according to all known laws of aviation. hahah thats not even funny. the other day my friend accidentally sent the entire bee movie script to her friend because its a shortcut in her phone and she fell asleep and accdientally typed and sent it to a semi randomy person. really makes me laugh. okay this should be enough now i wish i could actually fill this with content but unfortnutely i am not ready and need everything to look pretty first. </p>

      <p> Our site is optimized for clarity, not clutter. Every paragraph counts. Every link leads to discovery.</p>

      <p> does this even work</p>

      <p> Community is central to what we do. If you’re into creative tools, low-res aesthetics, and late 90s tech, you’re in good company.</p>
