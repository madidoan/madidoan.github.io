      <h4>
        My Own Private Idaho
      </h4>

      <p> I don't know what it is about this movie, it's not like I can personally relate to many of the themes, yet sometimes that is what makes certain films stand out the most. When they so masterfully tell a story that fills you with empathy and fully immerses you into an unknown world, I gain a new level of appreciation.</p>

      <p> We see pleasing to the eye production methods that borrow from Lynchian, Shakespearean, and post-modern elements. Alongside the aesthetics and styling, this film explores ideas of class opposition, queer identity, and alienation. This contains an emotional depth that was cutting-edge for its time. It elicits all the right emotions. Not to mention: Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix. I highly recommend the watch. </p>

      <h4>Just Kids</h4>

      <p> Recently, I began reading "Just Kids" by Patti Smith and I am quite excited to embark on this journey. The heyday of women's 60's literature strikes again, but reasonably so. I will update this section when I am far enough to have something to say. </p>

      <h4>GA&C</h4>

      <p> An app I have enjoyed interacting with recently is Google Arts & Culture. This is phenomenal for inspiration, discovery, and engaging with phyical arts digitally. You can read, listen, play, tour, and so much more. You'll just have to check it out yourself. </p>

      <p> My favorite features are categorizing art by medium and color, the "themes" page that allows coupled niche exploration, and the "inspire" tab is a nice supplement to a doomscroll. They're leaning into AI pretty hard, which is the biggest setback I have. While I have come to terms with the democratization of art through AI, there are still ehtical concerns. Nonetheless, still a wonderful app that deserves all the praise! </p>
