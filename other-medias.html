      <p> Do not fret. I consume all types of media. Here are more offers of digestion on my behalf. </p>

      <p> I don't know what it is about this movie, it's not like I can relate to many of the rhetorics, yet sometimes that is what ends up being the most standout factor for certain films. When they so masterfully tell a story that fills you with empathy and fully immerses you, I gain a new level of appreciation. We see pleasing to the eye production methods that involve Lynchian, Shakespearean, and post-modern elements.  Alongside the aesthetics and styling, this film explores ideas of class opposition, queer expploration, and alienation. It was cutting-edge for it's time and elicits all the right emotions. Not to mention Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix. I highly recommend the watch. </p>

      <p> How I have gone this far in life without watching Sex and the City, I am not sure, but I am glad I am hopping on this train now. First off, it was way ahead of it's time in terms of dismantling the taboo around sex. The kind of conclusions they were coming to about men has rang true and still does to this day (sadly). Lastly, it's good fun to imagine yourself in their extravagant (yet unreallistic) NYC socialite lifestyle of high fasion and going out for drinks every night. SATC is an easy but witty watch and I suggest it to any woman. Or man but if cis-het than it's giving off clario-matcha-feminist-literature performative vibes. </p>

      <p> An app I have enjoyed interacting with recently is Google Arts & Culture. This is just phenomenal for inspiration, discovery, and engaging phyical arts digitally. You can read, listen, play, tour, and so much more. You just have to check it out yourself. </p>

      <p> My favorite features are categorizing art by medium and color, the "themes" page that allows coupled niche exporation, and the "inspire" tab is quite nice to supplement a doomscroll. They are kinda embraced AI pretty hard and thats the biggest setback I have is that there are a lot of options to create AI Art. I have come to terms with the democratization of art through AI, but I still have ehtical concerns. Regardless, a wonderful app that deserves all the praise! </p>
