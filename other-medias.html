      <p> I don't know what it is about this movie, it's not like I can relate to many of the rhetorics, yet sometimes that is what ends up being the most outstanding factor for certain films. When they so masterfully tell a story that fills you with empathy and fully immerses you, I gain a new level of appreciation. We see pleasing to the eye production methods that involve Lynchian, Shakespearean, and post-modern elements.  Alongside the aesthetics and styling, this film explores ideas of class opposition, queer expploration, and alienation. It was cutting-edge for it's time and elicits all the right emotions. Not to mention Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix. I highly recommend the watch. </p>

      <p> Recently, I began reading "Just Kids" by Patti Smith and I am quite excited to embark on this journey. The heyday of 60's women's literature strikes again, but reasonably so. I will update this section when I am far enough to have something to say.  </p>

      <p> An app I have enjoyed interacting with recently is Google Arts & Culture. This is phenomenal for inspiration, discovery, and engaging phyical arts digitally. You can read, listen, play, tour, and so much more. You just have to check it out yourself. </p>

      <p> My favorite features are categorizing art by medium and color, the "themes" page that allows coupled niche exporation, and the "inspire" tab is quite nice to supplement a doomscroll. They are kinda embraced AI pretty hard and thats the biggest setback I have is that there are a lot of options to create AI Art. I have come to terms with the democratization of art through AI, but I still have ehtical concerns. Regardless, a wonderful app that deserves all the praise! </p>
