      <p> I don't know what it is about this movie, it's not like I can relate to many of the rhetorics, yet sometimes that is what ends up being the most standout factor for certain films. When they so masterfully tell a story that fills you with empathy and fully emerces you, I gain a new level of appreciation. We see pleasing to the eye production methods that involve Lynchian, Shakespearean, and post-modern elements.  Alongside the aesthetics and styling, this film explores ideas of class opposition, queer expploration, and alienation. It was cutting-edge for it's time and elicits all the right emotions. Not to mention Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix. I highly recommend the watch. </p>

      <p> Community and tribalism is key to residential comfortability. </p>

      <p> Community is central to what we do. If you’re into creative tools, low-res aesthetics, and late 90s tech, you’re in good company.</p>
