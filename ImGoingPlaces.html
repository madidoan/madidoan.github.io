    Such a beautiful historic and lively city. The fashion is impeccable and the natives maintain an effortless scandanavian "soft" look.
    Tons of food options, pretty much everything you crave you can find, price is more of the issue.
    Public transportation is easy to navigate and somewhat cheap.

    So far, my favorite sub-city/neighborhood is Norrebro. It maintains a great multicultural population and there were tons of cute small shops, one of my favorites being a jewelry maker that averages about 35 Krone (around 6 usd). I loved people watching here as well.

    If you are looking for second-hand high end brands, Fresricksburg is a great place for that. Ganni is a Denmark original luxury brand that is popular and quality. Althoough buying it second hand is still pricey, its definitely worth looking for.
    I have found great affordable thrift shops as well. There is a great corner in the city that is home to Decades Vintage, Episode, which not only has second hand goods but refurbished clothing such a pants made from blankets and cut up demin. My favorite, though, was Prag Indre By. This place was very well organized, having sections for item you cam imagine, and maintained decent prices as well.
