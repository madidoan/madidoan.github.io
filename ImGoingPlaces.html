    Copenhagen: 
    Such a beautiful historic and lively city. The fashion is impeccable and the natives maintain an effortless scandanavian "soft" look.
    Tons of food options, pretty much everything you crave you can find, price is more of the issue.
    Public transportation is easy to navigate and somewhat cheap.
