      <p> Let me stray away from gatekeeping. Here is what I have been into lately on all fronts. </p>

      <p> Music is my most important and prominent feature here. I am consumed by the endless facets music may entail. It is something that so easily can give insight to state of mind or even steer it towards one. One of the easiest ways to connect people and add enjoyment to any circumstance. Here is what I recommend.</p>

      <p> First off, I would like to start with a fan-favorite, Miles Davis. I know his bee-bop era is the most notable and influential of his discography, but what I admire about Miles Davis, is that he knew music is ever-changing and did well to adapt to the evolving atmosphere. The Man With The Horn (1981) is a perfect introduction to 80's style music, with a slap bass, electric guitar, and synths, while still holding true to his spectacular trumpet melody. This album marked the comeback of Miles Davis, with many band features, vocals, and a jazz-rock vibe. Similar to Bitches Brew, which is also a great turning point album of his. My favorite track is Back Seat Betty. Give it a listen! </p>

      <p> Community is central to what we do. If you’re into creative tools, low-res aesthetics, and late 90s tech, you’re in good company.</p>
