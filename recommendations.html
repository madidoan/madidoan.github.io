      <p>   Music is my most important and prominent feature. I am consumed by the endless facets music can entail. Here's what I have been into lately:</p>

      <img src="pics/miles.jpg" alt="TMWTH" width="150" height="150">

      <p>   First off, I would like to start with a fan-favorite, Miles Davis. I know his bebop era is the most significant and influential part of his discography, but what I admire about him that he knew music is ever-changing and adapted well to the evolving atmosphere. The Man With The Horn (1981) is a perfect introduction to 80's style jazz, with a slap bass, electric guitar, and synths, all woven into his spectacular trumpet melodies. This album marked the comeback of Miles Davis and features vocals, collaborations, and a jazz-rock vibe. Similar to Bitches Brew, which is also a pivotal album of his. My favorite track is Back Seat Betty. Give it a listen! </p>

      <p> There is a certain formula in this song that just scratches an itch in my ear. The piano hits all the right notes to echo a whimsical Bowie song, while both guitars add an element to ground it. The piano sequence also reminds me of "Belize" by Danger Mouse and MF Doom. From my code to your ears: </p>

      <p> If you know me, you know I am incredibly fond of Beach House. They will indefinitely be my favorite band. They perfectly encapsulate the wide array of instruments and sequences you can use to create harmonic and melodic goodness. Some may say they're boring or too slow because they don't follow an upbeat scheme, but I think the beauty lies in the methodical components that deserve to be listened to with intentionality. They recently came to Oklahoma City and I nearly cried. (It was one of their four destinations for the tour in North America) It was such an intimate and meaningful concert for me. Here's one of the clips I want to share:  </p>

      At the moment, I am also into Starflyer 59, Copenhagen Lorem, French electronica soundtracks (The Virgin Suicides and Fantastic Planet), The Hollies, A Moon Shaped Pool, and Dean Blunt and affiliates. Press my sweet hovering button to check out more.
